### Project goal  
To design a concept for a sustainable, eco-friendly library where the physical and digital space both inspire learning about green living, urban gardening, and environmental responsibility.

### My role  
- Making weather animations from an API based on actual conditions  
- Creating variants of the mascotte  
- Slight back-end work  

### Tools used  
SvelteKit ¬∑ SCSS ¬∑ GSAP ¬∑ Accessibility best practices  

### Description  
We were commissioned to optimize and enhance the current live library-in-bloei website. Previously, several CMD minor students developed their own version of the library-in-bloei website. They experimented with a weather API. They also developed concepts such as a seasonal theme and the mascot Harry. Our task was to integrate these concepts into the live library-in-bloei website.

### Project goal  
To create a modern, responsive news website for *Redpers*, an independent journalism initiative, as part of a group project during my third semester at FDND.

### My role  
- Front-end development in SvelteKit  
- cleaning up files using the boy scout rule

### Tools used

### Description  
We were commissioned to create a modern, responsive news website for *Redpers*, an independent journalism initiative.  
The goal of this project was to make the website more user-friendly and accessible. The site was not yet fully responsive and doesn‚Äôt work perfectly on all devices. We worked to change that. We focused on frontend design and development principles, standards, and best practices to create a solution for the client that follows RAP/PE. This includes responsiveness, accessibility, performance, and progressive enhancement.
